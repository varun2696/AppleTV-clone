# Apple TV+ Clone 
---
<p>
This was a individual construct week project at Masai School.
Goal behind the project was to create a clone of the Apple TV+ website as close as possible to the original one with all the major functionalities of this website, such as User Authentication, User Details Management, Series & Shows gallery and carousels and Show Details.
This project was built by me in 5 Days.
