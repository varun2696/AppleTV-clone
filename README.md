# Apple TV+ Clone 
---
<p>
This project was an individual assignment during my time at Masai School's Construct Week. The goal behind the project was to create a clone of the Apple TV+ website, replicating it as closely as possible to the original, complete with all the major functionalities. These functionalities included User Authentication, User Details Management, Series & Shows gallery, carousels, and Show Details. I completed this project in just 5 days.
